# 🌊 Michael Gene Brockus (Dreamer)

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m **Michael Gene Brockus**, also known as **Dreamer** — a systems-focused developer with both **blue-collar grit** and **white-collar precision**.  
I’ve worked in production, logistics, and technology, and I bring that same discipline and adaptability into everything I build.  

I’m the creator of **Fossil Logic**, an open-source initiative dedicated to **secure, auditable, and explainable software**, and **Fossil Learning**, an educational project for developers who want to understand systems from the metal up.

## 🧠 About Me

I build **transparent and trustworthy software systems** using **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **CrabQL** — always with a focus on **traceability**, **security**, and **clarity**.  
From **AI frameworks** and **lightweight databases** to **low-level runtime systems**, my work is driven by the belief that software should be **understandable, verifiable, and durable**.

My experience ranges from **hands-on industrial work** — operating machinery, packing, and logistics — to **system architecture and embedded software engineering**.  
That background gives me a rare perspective: I value both **practical efficiency** and **technical integrity**, and I build tools that reflect both worlds.

## 🦴 Fossil Logic – Open Source Projects

**Fossil Logic** is my personal open-source software initiative focused on **low-level systems**, **AI explainability**, **secure infrastructure**, and **auditable software design**.  
I build intelligent technologies in **C**, **C++**, and **Python** with an emphasis on **traceability**, **minimal dependencies**, and **self-contained logic**.

The mission is simple: to create software that is **efficient**, **reliable**, and **transparent** — helping developers and organizations trust the systems they depend on.

At the core of Fossil Logic is the idea that software should balance **performance with accountability**.  
Whether developing a **lightweight database**, **secure runtime**, or **interpretable AI**, I prioritize **clarity over complexity** and **robustness over shortcuts**.

Fossil Logic represents my ongoing effort to build a future where technology remains **lean**, **secure**, and **explainable** — empowering developers to build with confidence and users to interact with trust.

### 📘 Fossil Learning

To complement my development work, I created **Fossil Learning** — an educational initiative offering open-source tutorials, labs, and guides focused on **low-level programming**, **AI explainability**, and **secure software design**.

Through practical examples and transparent explanations, Fossil Learning helps developers understand systems deeply, code responsibly, and adopt best practices for building **auditable**, **reliable**, and **trustworthy** software.

## 💬 Philosophy

I believe good software — like good work — should be **built to last**, **understandable by design**, and **accountable in practice**.  
Whether I’m writing embedded code, tuning a production line, or designing an AI framework, I approach each task with the same principles:  
**clarity, traceability, and purpose.**
