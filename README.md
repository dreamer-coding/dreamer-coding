# 🌊 Michael Gene Brockus (Dreamer) – GitHub Profile

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm **Michael Gene Brockus**, also known as **Dreamer**, a systems-focused developer and founder of **Fossil Logic**, where I create lightweight, secure, and forward-looking software—often from the metal up.

## 🧠 About Me

I specialize in building intelligent, transparent, and secure software systems using **C, C++, Python, SQL**, and **CrabQL**. My work focuses on **trust-critical**, **hardware-close**, and **audit-capable** environments, where **efficiency**, **traceability**, and **integrity** are non-negotiable.

I believe in building tools that are not only powerful but also explainable—where data, logic, and outcomes can be verified and reasoned about by humans.

## 🔧 Skills Overview

- **Systems Programming (C/C++)**: Embedded AI, kernel-like libraries, platform abstractions.
- **AI & Language Tech**: Truthful Intelligence, input normalization, blockchain-like memory, tone/emotion/sarcasm filters.
- **Python & CLI Tools**: Automation, testing frameworks, developer tools.
- **SQL/CrabQL**: Graph-relational hybrid database design and optimization.
- **Security-First Engineering**: Hardened runtime logic, trust chains, sandboxing, validation pipelines.
- **Test Frameworks**: Smart testing, sarcasm-aware test output, block-level audit trails.
- **Cross-Platform GUI & Graphics**: Hardware-accelerated OpenGL GUI layer (OpenCUBE).
- **Linux Admin & DevOps**: Bare-metal installs, secure configuration, system-level utilities.

## 🧩 Core Fossil Logic Projects

These are the flagship open-source technologies I architect and maintain:

### 🧠 Jellyfish AI + Truthful Intelligence (TI)
- Lightweight, blockchain-inspired AI library in pure C.
- Focused on **traceable learning**, **tamper-resistant memory**, and **self-pruning behavior**.
- Foundation of **Truthful Intelligence (TI)**: AI that explains itself, detects tone, filters deception, and reflects on past behavior.

### 🍕 Pizza Test
- Smart testing framework tailored for **truth-critical systems**.
- Handles tone analysis, sarcasm detection, fuzzy matching, leetspeak normalization, and more.
- Plays a central role in testing **Jellyfish AI** and **ToFu logic chains**.

### 🧠 ToFu – Truthful Functions (Data Structures & Algorithms)
- Core algorithmic layer for **Truthful Intelligence (TI)**.
- Provides specialized **data structures** for logical blocks, memory chains, confidence maps, and validation paths.
- Implements **reasoning algorithms** for transparent, auditable decision-making and self-reflection.
- Powers TI's ability to trace logic, detect inconsistencies, and explain outcomes step-by-step.

### 🦀 Blue Crab Database
- Hybrid graph-relational engine using **CrabQL**.
- Built for **auditability**, **flexibility**, and **runtime adaptability**.
- Backend for **MyShell**, **NoShell**, and **TimeShell** structured data shells.

### 🧪 Fossil Io – Intelligent I/O Processing
- Secure and interpretable I/O stack built for human-AI interaction.
- Features advanced filters: sarcasm detection, tone classification, leetspeak normalization, fake news identification, and grammar correction.
- Enables **Jellyfish AI** to process, sanitize, and reason about input with integrity.
- Core to **Truthful Intelligence (TI)** for assessing validity, confidence, and emotional tone.

### 🛡️ Fossil Sys – Secure System Infrastructure
- Lightweight system-layer tools and APIs for secure, low-level control.
- Includes Linux utilities, memory-safe runtime support, CLI environments, and hardware introspection.
- Provides the secure foundation for all Fossil Logic modules, including **Shark**, **Blue Crab**, and **OpenCUBE**.
- Designed with **auditability**, **minimalism**, and **zero-external-dependency** principles.

### 🧊 OpenCUBE
- Cross-platform graphics and UI engine in C.
- No external dependencies—abstracts OpenGL, GLM, GLEW into one unified platform.
- Supports both 2D/3D with minimal, hardware-accelerated rendering.
- Used for GUI tooling across Fossil Logic projects.

### 🦈 Shark CLI
- Powerful, cross-platform command-line interface for interacting with all Fossil Logic systems.
- Supports configuration management, AI module introspection, database queries, and automated testing.
- Designed for extensibility and deep integration with Jellyfish AI and Blue Crab.

### 🐟 This CLI
- Lightweight tool for managing Fossil Logic project workflows and environment setup.
- Focused on developer productivity and rapid prototyping.
- Handles build orchestration, dependency management, and environment diagnostics.

### 🐠 Fish CLI
- Specialized command-line tool for real-time monitoring and analysis of AI runtime behavior.
- Provides interactive logs, performance metrics, and debugging interfaces for Jellyfish AI chains.

### 🦀 Crabd CLI
- Command-line utility for managing the Blue Crab database engine.
- Supports schema migrations, data import/export, query execution, and audit trail inspection.

### 🦀 CrabCTL
- Administrative CLI for advanced control of Blue Crab clusters and database nodes.
- Enables distributed database configuration, replication management, and health checks.

## 🔍 How I Work

- 🧬 Everything is **traceable**, **auditable**, and **explained**—whether it's logic flow or test results.
- 🔐 **Security-first**, always—especially in input processing and AI learning behavior.
- 🏗️ Custom-built tools from the ground up, with zero external dependencies when possible.
- 📜 I write clean, intentional code with robust docs and tests to back it.
