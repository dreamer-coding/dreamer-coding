- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

I work at an Amazon fulfillment center packing boxes for shipment and water
spidering supplies to all of the packers, and when I'm not doing that I'm
working on my software development since I aspire to build unique applications,
tools, libraries, games, discord bots, pretty much anything else as well. I
have found that solving puzzles is my forte as I love to solve problems and
provide solutions that may be novel, functional, and streamlined.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and employ them on the
spot; however, the most common programming languages you will find me using most
often is (`c`, `c++`, `python`, `kotlin`, `java`). In regards to platform
preference, I don’t depend on a particular platform since I am fine with developing
on Mac OS, Windows 10, Chromebook, and any Linux variant. My favorite of them all
would have to be the Raspberry PI, I like them for being robust, reasonably efficient,
and being able to fit in small places.
